# iptablelog spacific location

These logs are generated by the kernel, so they go to the file that receives kernel logs: `/var/log/kern.log`

If you want to redirect these logs to a different file, that can't be done through iptables. It can be done in the configuration of the program that dispatches logs: rsyslog. In the iptables rule, add a prefix that isn't used by any other kernel log:


```
iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.11.0/24 -j LOG --log-prefix='[netfilter] '
```

Following the example set by `20-ufw.conf,` create a file under `/etc/rsyslog.d/00-my_iptables.conf` containing:

```
:msg,contains, "[netfilter] " -/var/log/iptables.log
& stop
```

Putting the rule early (the file names in `/etc/rsyslog.d` are used in lexicographic order) and adding `&stop` causes these logs to go only to the specified location and not to the default location as well.

Rsyslog has to be restarted for the config changes to take place.
